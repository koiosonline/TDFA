#### Algorithm
A sequence of computer-implementable instructions, typically to solve a class of problems or to perform a computation. In trading, algorithms are used to automate trading stratgies and execute orders on exchanges. Often called: algorithmic trading or algo trading. Algo's are used by traders, exchanges, market makers and many more market participants.<br/><br/>
#### Allocation
Refers to capital. Capital allocation is the strategically positioning and distribution of capital. Often of course, with the intent to maximise profits or capital protection. Example: 50% of your capital can be allocated.<br/><br/>
#### Alpha
Alpha, often considered the active return on an investment, gauges the performance of an investment against a market index or benchmark that is considered to represent the market's movement as a whole. The excess return of an investment relative to the return of a benchmark index is the investment's alpha.<br/><br/>
#### Angel investor
An individual providing the first investment into a new company, typically in exchange for ownership equity in the company. <br/><br/>
#### API
Application Programming Interface. Can been seen as a software intermediary that makes communication between multiple applications. In trading, exchanges provide API's traders can connect to. Via an API, a trader/application/program can send and receive information to the exchange's API. This allows for, for example, placing orders. Automated trading is done via API's.<br/><br/>
#### Arbitrage
Taking advantage of price differences between two or more markets on an asset. An example: buying an asset on exchange A for $100,- and selling the asset on exchange B for $110,-. Note that this proces can also be automated and there are dedicated arbitrage bots active in mboth traditional and cryptocurrency markets.<br/><br/>
#### Artificial intelligence
Often called 'AI'. In trading, an automated (self learning / machine learning) trading strategy is often called a trading bot and can be seen as Artificial Intelligence. Self learning strategies are very sophisticated and operate in larger markets. Some of the most succesful trading firms in the world use AI. AI is also be used to analyse (financial) data and build portfolio's.<br/><br/>
#### Ask
The price 'asked' by the seller of an asset.<br/><br/>
#### Asset
Something that is owned by a person, company or organisation. In relation to finance, we can speak of current and non-current assets and tangible and intangible assets. Examples of financial assets are: stocks, bonds, equity, securities. For a more detailed definition of assets, check Investopedia, search for 'Asset'.<br/><br/>
#### Asset Class
An asset class is a grouping of investments that exhibit similar characteristics and are subject to the same laws and regulations. Examples of asset classes are: stocks, bonds, money market instruments, real estate, commodities, futures, financial derivatives and cryptocurrencies.<br/><br/>

Relates to options. An option is at the money (ATM) if the strike price is the same as the current spot price of the underlying security.<br/><br/>

## B

#### Backtest
Refers to trading strategies. Backtesting is the practice of testing a strategy's performance over time by using real historical data and reconstruct trades provided by one's strategy. This is usually done using backtesting software or by using programming languages such as Python. Backtesting can be done, to a certain degree, within Tradingview. But for more advanced analysis a manual approach is recommended. If you're up for that, check out Quantopian.<br/><br/>

#### Bond

Unlike stocks, bonds don't give you ownership rights.<br/><br/>
#### Broker

#### Candlestick
Also called: 'Japanese' candlestick. The Japanese candlestick is a representation of price. It includes the opening price, the closing price, the highest price and the lowest price of an asset in a specified amount of time.

#### Compounding
Compounding occurs when your investment earnings or savings account interest is added to your principal, forming a larger base on which future earnings may accumulate. As your investment base gets larger, it has the potential to grow faster. And the longer your money is invested, the more you stand to gain from compounding.<br/><br/>
